Question: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Answer:
git merge is a straightforward method of implementing changes from one branch into another. 

- Creates a new merge commit in the target branch and brings changes from the source branch. 
- Preserves the branch history and track when changes were made in the source branch implemented in the target branch. 
- Can lead to a cluttered commit history with multiple merge commits, especially if multiple branches are frequently merged into the same branch.



git rebase is a more advanced method of integrating changes from one branch into another.

- git rebase takes the changes from the source branch and reapplies them on top of the target branch. 
- linear branch history 
- easier to follow the flow of changes
- Can cause conflicts if the target branch has changed since the source branch was created.
- modifies the branch's existing history
- difficult to revert changes
